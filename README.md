# DeeplearningProject
Objective: Arabic Automated short answers grading system and Smart Assistance for islamic
education for schoolers, the idea behind this system is to give the adequate grade to the students
according to their answers (grades from 0 to 20), the system should be in Arabic, and you should
prepare your own dataset by collecting row data from several resource by using the scraping
technics, the system should also assist the student by generating certain guidelines during the
process of evaluation according to their progression.
• Scraping data from several sources: Arabic websites, Datasets, books, etc.
• Establishment of Arabic Natural language processing pipeline.
• Doing some EDA technics to understand your data.
• Word embedding and encoding.
• Model Training based on RNN, LSTM and Transformer.
• Text generation for student assistance: BERT (Fine Tuning), Prompt / Fine tuning of LLMs
like: GPT 3, Falcon and Alpaca.
• Evaluation of the models then the choice of the best one by using several metrics: ROC,
accuracy, f1 score, blue score, etc.
• Model deployment (Best one according to your experiments) by using docker containers and
kubernetes orchestration and consumption via SAP web application (Angular).
